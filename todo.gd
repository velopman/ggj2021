# ggj ideas:
# - theme: Lost and found
# - diversifiers:
#     - accessibility:
#         - Spinal Tap (slider for all audio types)
#     - art:
#         - Are we ASCIIng too much? (ascii graphics)
#         - Get to the point (pointillist style, shaders?)
#     - code:
#         - RNG (but for something typically static)
#     - design:
#         - Moving the goalposts (objective changes each time it's played)
#         - How many of you are in there? (twitch chat?)
#     - meta:
#         - On the safe side (100km team)
#         - A-Party (game for video call)

# Chat based team maze escape game
#	Each player joins the game and is assigned to a team
#	Once the game starts they can input "up", "down", "left", "right" to move the character
#		fuzzy search for terms "pu" "dwon"
#		input.sort() <union> "down" && input.size() ~= "down".size()
#	First team to escape the maze wins
